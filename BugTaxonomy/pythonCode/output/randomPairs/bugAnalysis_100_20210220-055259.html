</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The CAS protocol returns a ticket in the redirect URL and because each ticket can only be used once, by default phpCAS tries to issue a redirect to remove this ticket once it has been claimed. However, since the output has already been started (by the same <code>header.inc</code> as above), phpCAS can't send a redirect to the client.</p>\n<p>Again, this can be worked around in MRBS, but this is definitely not the proper solution. You can disable the phpCAS redirect by calling <code>phpCAS::setNoClearTicketsFromUrl();</code> at some point after the call to <code>phpCAS:client</code>, but this results in a less satasfactory user experience since the user is more likely to try to claim a ticket again in their browser history or a bookmark.</p>\n<p>I don't know enough about the MRBS templating system to know how to fix this. (I would guess either by moving all authentication before any rendering or wrapping all rendering in output buffering.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If anyone wants access to a CAS server to test, I now have one I can share - let me know.</p></div></div>\n  \n</div>\n\n                    ", "<div class=\"display_post\">\n<div><div class=\"markdown_content\"><p>Why does SourceForge never remember that I am logged in right as I post a ticket?</p></div></div>\u00a0\n            <div class=\"reactions\" style=\"user-select: none;

It turns out to be caused by IE for some reason not respecting the position: absolute property of the outline div.   Instead it gave it a relative position which caused it to appear somewhere to the bottom and right of the booking being resized.    This in turn caused IE to produce a vertical scrollbar, which then altered the table size but didn't alter the size of the booking.  This then led to the JavaScript calculating that the booking belonged to the next room.   (The appearance of the scrollbar also explains why it appeared to go away when Developer Tools was enabled - because the scrollbar was there in the first place and so the dimensions didn't change.)</p>\n<p>I've fixed the problem in Rev 2837 by adding !important to the property to stop IE overriding it - though I'm not sure why it does so in the first place.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbs/bugs/300/\">https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbs/bugs/300/</a></p>\n<p>Campbell</p></div></div>\u00a0\n            <div class=\"reactions\" style=\"user-select: none; cursor: default\">\n</div>\n<br/><small>Last edit: Campbell Morrison 2014-05-09</small>\n</div>"], "response": -1, "tags": "", "comments": ""}, {"subject": "phplist", "link": "https://www.github.com/phpList/phplist3/pull/141", "title": "[TASK] Require PHP >= 5.4", "status": "closed", "labels": [], "priority": null, "description": ["<p>And drop code that is required for lower PHP versions only, including\ncode for magic quotes or safe mode.</p>\n<p>Fixes #137</p>", ["<p>Nice one. phpList started with version 3 :-) Files were even called  .php3 in the beginning. </p>", "<p>This doesn't look correct.

The problem is that the timezone definitions in the standard release distribution have the double CR.  I suspect that this is caused by an incorrect EOL property setting in Subversion.   I will look into this and fix it for the next release.  In the meantime you can patch your system by replacing the tzurl directory on your webserver with the one attached here.
